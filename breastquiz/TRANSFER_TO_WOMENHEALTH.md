### **Method 1: Direct File Upload (Recommended - 5 minutes)**

**Step 1: Download Files from Current Project**
From your current NudgeNote Replit, download these files/folders from the `breastquiz/` directory:

```

   PORT = 5001
   ```

**Step 5: Initialize Database**
```bash
npm run db:push
```

**Step 6: Start Your Independent Platform**
