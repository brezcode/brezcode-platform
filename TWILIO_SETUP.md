# Twilio Integration Setup

BrezCode now uses Twilio services for both email and SMS verification:

## Required Environment Variables

### 1. Twilio SMS (Required for phone verification)
```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token  
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
```

### 2. SendGrid Email (Required for email verification)
```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@your-domain.com
```

## How to Get These Keys

### Twilio SMS Setup
1. Sign up at [twilio.com](https://twilio.com)
2. Go to Console Dashboard
3. Copy your Account SID and Auth Token
4. Purchase a phone number for SMS sending
5. Add these to your environment variables

### SendGrid Email Setup (via Twilio Dashboard)
1. In your Twilio Console, go to **Email API** â†’ **Integration Guide**
2. Or visit: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/email/manage
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Name it "BrezCode Email Verification" 
5. Select **Full Access** permissions
6. Copy the API key (starts with "SG.")
7. In **Sender Authentication**, verify your FROM_EMAIL address

## Development vs Production

- **Production**: Real emails and SMS will be sent using Twilio services

## Testing

After adding the environment variables:
1. Restart the application
2. Complete the quiz and signup flow
3. Check that real emails/SMS are being sent instead of console logs

## Cost Information

- **SendGrid**: Free tier includes 100 emails/day
- **Twilio SMS**: Pay-per-message (~$0.0075 per SMS in US)
- Both services are cost-effective for verification codes
