# GitHub Setup for leadgen.to Platform

## Why GitHub is Important for Your Platform

GitHub connection provides several key benefits:
- **Easy Updates**: Push changes directly from Replit to production
- **Team Collaboration**: Future developers can contribute to your platform
- **Version Control**: Track all changes to your business automation platform
- **Automatic Deployments**: Vercel can auto-deploy when you push updates
- **Backup**: Your entire leadgen.to platform is safely stored in the cloud

## GitHub Setup Solutions

### Method 1: Personal Access Token (Most Reliable)

1. **Create GitHub Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name: "Replit leadgen.to"
   - Select scopes: ✅ repo, ✅ workflow
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Copy the token** (you won't see it again)

2. **Connect in Replit:**
   - In Version Control panel, click "Connect to remote"
   - Choose "GitHub"
   - Paste your personal access token when prompted
   - Create repository: "leadgen-platform"

### Method 2: OAuth Re-authentication

### Method 3: Direct GitHub Repository Creation

1. **Create Repository Manually:**
