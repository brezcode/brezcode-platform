# üî• CLAUDE PROTOCOL - READ THIS FIRST EVERY SESSION üî•

## üìã MANDATORY STEPS AT START OF EVERY SESSION:

**ALWAYS READ THESE 4 DOCUMENTS FIRST:**

1. **READ CLAUDE_UNIVERSAL_PROTOCOL.md** - Universal working rules with Den
2. **READ CLAUDE_MEMORY.md** - Project-specific context and current status
3. **READ SESSION_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md** - Session restart handling
4. **READ STRATEGIC_MASTER_PLAN.md** - Complete architecture & roadmap

## üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- **CLAUDE_MEMORY.md is the master source of truth**
- **Always verify current deployment status** (curl live sites)
- **Never trust single documents** - cross-reference with reality
- **Update CLAUDE_MEMORY.md after every major step**

## üîÑ WHEN SESSIONS RESTART:
1. Read all 4 documents above
2. Check actual current state (pwd, git status, live sites)
3. Reconcile any discrepancies
4. **IMMEDIATELY PROVIDE COMPLETE STATUS SUMMARY TO DEN:**
   - Current phase and exact status
   - What's actually deployed and working
   - Next critical action needed
   - Any blockers or issues
   - Proof I'm updated and not confused
5. Continue from correct point

## ‚ö†Ô∏è FAILURE PREVENTION:
- Don't let secondary docs override CLAUDE_MEMORY.md
- Always check what's actually deployed/working
- Update memory immediately when reality changes
- **NO CONFUSING DEN** - Be clear and accurate
- **NO MESSING UP** - Double-check before responding
- **NO REPEAT PAST FAILURES** - Learn from documented mistakes

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA:
After reading these docs, I must demonstrate:
- Accurate knowledge of current project status
- Clear understanding of what's deployed and working
- No confusion about domains, platforms, or next steps
- Complete alignment with reality, not outdated documentation

**This protocol ensures continuity across session restarts and prevents memory confusion.**
