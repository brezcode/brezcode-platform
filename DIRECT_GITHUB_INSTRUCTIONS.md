# Direct GitHub Upload Instructions

Since the automatic upload isn't working, let's try a direct manual approach:

## Method 1: Create Files via GitHub Web Interface

### Step 1: Access Your Repository
1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/xynargyhk/[REPO_NAME]`
2. Look for any of these options:
   - "Create new file" button
   - "Add file" dropdown
   - "uploading an existing file" link
   - A pencil/edit icon

### Step 2: Try Direct URL Method
Try these URLs directly (replace [REPO_NAME] with your actual repo):

**To create README.md:**
`https://github.com/xynargyhk/[REPO_NAME]/new/main?filename=README.md`

**To create package.json:**
`https://github.com/xynargyhk/[REPO_NAME]/new/main?filename=package.json`

## Method 2: Alternative Repository Names to Try
The upload might be failing due to repository name mismatch. Try these variations:
- `leadgen-platform`
- `leadgen.to`  
- `leadgen`
- `leadgen-to`

## Method 3: Check Repository Settings
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Check if it's set to "Public" (required for easier Vercel deployment)
3. Verify the repository name

## Files Ready for Upload
I have all the leadgen.to platform files ready:
- ✅ Configuration files (package.json, vercel.json, tsconfig.json)
- ✅ React frontend with ProfileModule and BusinessLandingCreator
- ✅ Express backend with AI training system
- ✅ Database schemas for multi-tenant architecture
- ✅ All 195+ country support and international formatting

Once you can access the file creation interface, we can upload everything!
