## Testing Requirements (CRITICAL)
**MANDATORY TESTING PROTOCOL**: Never claim systems work without comprehensive frontend + backend testing.

**Testing Methodology**:
1. **Backend API Testing**: Verify endpoints return correct data structure
2. **Frontend Data Testing**: Confirm frontend receives and displays data correctly  
3. **User Experience Testing**: Test actual user workflows across multiple scenarios
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Test failure conditions and boundary cases
5. **Integration Testing**: Verify end-to-end functionality from user perspective

**Test Coverage Required**:
- Multiple user interaction scenarios
- Data persistence verification
- Frontend display condition validation
- API response structure verification
- Error handling and edge cases

**Success Criteria**: Minimum 90% success rate across comprehensive test scenarios before claiming functionality works.

**User Feedback**: "ALWAYS test backend and frontend, and make sure it works PERFECTLY from all directions and all scenarios, you need to think strategically much deeper"
