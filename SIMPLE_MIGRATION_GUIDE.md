# Super Simple Migration - Just 3 Steps!

## What I've Done For You

I've created everything you need in the `migration_package/` folder. Here's the simplest way to get your breast health platform running independently:

## Option 1: Copy & Paste Method (Easiest)

### Step 1: Create New Replit Project
1. Go to replit.com
2. Click "Create Repl" 
3. Choose "Node.js" template
4. Name it "WomenHealth"

### Step 2: Copy Files
I'll help you copy each file directly. Just:
1. Create the folders I tell you
2. Copy and paste the content I provide
3. That's it!

### Step 3: Run Commands
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Ready Files in migration_package/:

**âœ… All 17 files are ready to copy:**
- package.json (dependencies)
- Hero component with "1 in 8 women" statistic  
- Health report system
- Database setup
- Complete React app
- Express server

## I Can Help You With Each File

Would you like me to:
1. **Guide you through copying each file one by one?** (I'll show you exactly what to copy/paste)
2. **Create a downloadable package?** 
3. **Walk through it step by step together?**

The migration is actually just copying 17 files - much simpler than it sounds! 

**Which approach would you prefer?** I can make this super easy for you.
