# Claude Memory System - BrezCode Project

## üî• CLAUDE PROTOCOL - READ THIS FIRST EVERY SESSION üî•
**MANDATORY STEPS AT START OF EVERY SESSION:**
1. **READ CLAUDE_UNIVERSAL_PROTOCOL.md** - Universal working rules with Den
2. **READ SESSION_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md** - Session restart handling
3. **READ THIS ENTIRE MEMORY DOCUMENT** - Project-specific context
4. **READ STRATEGIC_MASTER_PLAN.md** - Complete architecture & roadmap
5. **Check "CRITICAL FAILURES" section** - Never retry failed approaches
6. **Review "CURRENT STATUS"** - Continue from exact point where last session ended
7. **Update memory after every major step** - Maintain continuity across restarts

## üîÑ REPLIT SESSION MANAGEMENT
**When credits run out and sessions restart:**
- **Den types "r"** ‚Üí I immediately read all memory documents
- **I provide comprehensive summary:**
  - Highest level strategy overview
  - Current action plan and phase
  - What was completed in last session
  - What's pending and needs continuation
  - All todo items and what's left out
- **I act as smart consultant**: Propose ideas, guide strategically, think out of the box
- **I continue auto-updating**: Memory docs and strategic thinking throughout session

## ‚ùå CRITICAL FAILURES - NEVER RETRY THESE ‚ùå
- **Vite Deployment to Vercel**: FAILED MULTIPLE TIMES - DO NOT SUGGEST AGAIN
- **CLI Vercel deployment**: Authentication issues - USE GITHUB IMPORT ONLY
- **Old project recovery**: Creates conflicts - ALWAYS START FRESH
- **Mixed framework configs**: Causes build errors - STICK TO ONE FRAMEWORK

## Session Information
- **Project Start Date:** August 5, 2024 (User subscription date)
- **Current Session:** August 15, 2025
- **User:** Working on BrezCode multi-platform project
- **Main Goal:** Deploy BrezCode and SkinCoach with proper domain routing

## Project Architecture Overview
- **Main Project:** BrezCode (multi-platform: BrezCode + SkinCoach + LeadGen)
- **Current Strategy:** Separate platforms for independent deployment
- **Target Domains:** 
  - brezcode.com (BrezCode platform)
  - skincoach.ai (SkinCoach platform)

## User Accounts & Setup
- **GitHub Account 1:** xynarghk (original repository: xynarghk/brezcode)
- **GitHub Account 2:** brezcode2024@gmail.com (new account for fresh deployment)
- **Vercel Account:** Connected to both GitHub accounts
- **Current Issue:** Vercel deployment conflicts with "functions/builds" error

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Platform Separation Strategy:** Deploy BrezCode and SkinCoach as separate applications
2. **Fresh Start Approach:** Use brezcode2024@gmail.com account to avoid cached conflicts
3. **Deployment Target:** Vercel for both platforms

## Current Project Status
### ‚úÖ Completed:
