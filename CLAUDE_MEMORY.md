# Claude Memory System - BrezCode Project

## üî• CLAUDE PROTOCOL - READ THIS FIRST EVERY SESSION üî•
**MANDATORY STEPS AT START OF EVERY SESSION:**
1. **READ CLAUDE_UNIVERSAL_PROTOCOL.md** - Universal working rules with Den
2. **READ SESSION_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md** - Session restart handling
3. **READ THIS ENTIRE MEMORY DOCUMENT** - Project-specific context
4. **READ STRATEGIC_MASTER_PLAN.md** - Complete architecture & roadmap
5. **Check "CRITICAL FAILURES" section** - Never retry failed approaches
6. **Review "CURRENT STATUS"** - Continue from exact point where last session ended
7. **Update memory after every major step** - Maintain continuity across restarts

## üîÑ REPLIT SESSION MANAGEMENT
**When credits run out and sessions restart:**
- **Den types "r"** ‚Üí I immediately read all memory documents
- **I provide comprehensive summary:**
  - Highest level strategy overview
  - Current action plan and phase
  - What was completed in last session
  - What's pending and needs continuation
  - All todo items and what's left out
- **I act as smart consultant**: Propose ideas, guide strategically, think out of the box
- **I continue auto-updating**: Memory docs and strategic thinking throughout session

## ‚ùå CRITICAL FAILURES - NEVER RETRY THESE ‚ùå
- **Vite Deployment to Vercel**: FAILED MULTIPLE TIMES - DO NOT SUGGEST AGAIN
- **CLI Vercel deployment**: Authentication issues - USE GITHUB IMPORT ONLY
- **Old project recovery**: Creates conflicts - ALWAYS START FRESH
- **Mixed framework configs**: Causes build errors - STICK TO ONE FRAMEWORK

## Session Information
- **Project Start Date:** August 5, 2024 (User subscription date)
- **Current Session:** August 13, 2025
- **User:** Working on BrezCode multi-platform project
- **Main Goal:** Deploy BrezCode and SkinCoach as separate platforms

## Project Architecture Overview
- **Main Project:** BrezCode (multi-platform: BrezCode + SkinCoach + LeadGen)
- **Current Strategy:** Separate platforms for independent deployment
- **Target Domains:** 
  - brezcode.com (BrezCode platform)
  - skincoach.ai (SkinCoach platform)

## User Accounts & Setup
- **GitHub Account 1:** xynarghk (original repository: xynarghk/brezcode)
- **GitHub Account 2:** brezcode2024@gmail.com (new account for fresh deployment)
- **Vercel Account:** Connected to both GitHub accounts
- **Current Issue:** Vercel deployment conflicts with "functions/builds" error

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Platform Separation Strategy:** Deploy BrezCode and SkinCoach as separate applications
2. **Fresh Start Approach:** Use brezcode2024@gmail.com account to avoid cached conflicts
3. **Deployment Target:** Vercel for both platforms

## Current Project Status
### ‚úÖ Completed:
- SkinCoach standalone project created at `/workspace/skincoach-standalone/`
- All SkinCoach components copied from main project
- SkinCoach server configuration completed
- BrezCode standalone project created at `/workspace/brezcode-standalone/`
- All SkinCoach components removed from BrezCode standalone
- BrezCode routing cleaned (removed SkinCoach imports and routes)

### ‚úÖ Additional Completed:
- Created COMPLETE BrezCode platform at `/workspace/brezcode-complete/`
- Includes ALL features: health, business, AI training, avatar management, skin analysis
- Enhanced with LeadGen business tools and SkinCoach health analysis
- Clean server configuration with graceful route loading
- Successful build process (2.3MB client + 597KB server)

- Persistent "functions property cannot be used in conjunction with builds property" error
- Tried multiple framework presets (Vite, Create React App, Other, Node.js)
- CLI deployment authentication issues
- **CRITICAL DECISION: Abandoned Vite approach**

### ‚úÖ Recent Major Progress:

- **Successfully converted Vite to Next.js**: Build works perfectly
- **Hybrid Architecture Decided**: 
  - Frontend: Vercel (Next.js) 
  - Backend: Railway (Express server)
- **GitHub Upload**: brezcode-frontend repository uploaded to GitHub

## üéØ CURRENT STATUS - AUGUST 14, 2025

- **CURRENT PHASE**: Phase 1 - Deployment & Domain Setup
- **NEXT ACTION**: Deploy Next.js from GitHub to Vercel (NOT CLI, NOT Vite)
- **SESSION MGMT**: ‚úÖ "r" trigger protocol established
- **RESTART TEST**: Ready to test - restart shell, type "r", get full summary
- **CONSULTANT MODE**: ‚úÖ Strategic guidance, out-of-box thinking, proactive proposals

## üìã CURRENT TODO LIST
1. **Deploy Next.js from GitHub to Vercel** (Phase 1) - PENDING
2. **Configure domain routing** for all 3 platforms - PENDING  
3. **Set up Railway backend deployment** - PENDING
