REPLACE YOUR EXISTING package.json WITH THIS SIMPLE VERSION:

{
  "name": "breast-health-platform",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Independent breast health assessment platform with WHO statistics",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "dev": "node app.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. In your BreastHealthMigrate project, open the existing package.json file
2. Delete ALL the current content
3. Replace it with the simple version above (between the { } brackets)
4. Save the file
5. Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in Console)
6. Run: npm start

This removes all the complex LeadGen dependencies and configurations, keeping only what's needed for your simple breast health platform.
