      title: 'Breast Self-Examination Steps',
      content: `Breast self-examination is an important part of breast health awareness. Here's how to perform it properly:

1. **Visual Inspection**: Stand in front of a mirror with your arms at your sides. Look for any changes in size, shape, skin texture, or color.

2. **Raise Your Arms**: Lift your arms overhead and look for the same changes.

3. **Check for Discharge**: Gently squeeze each nipple to check for any discharge.

4. **Lying Down Examination**: Lie down and use your right hand to examine your left breast, and vice versa. Use the pads of your fingers to feel for lumps or changes.

5. **Circular Motion**: Move in small circles from the outside of the breast toward the nipple, covering the entire breast and armpit area.

**When to Perform**: The best time is 3-5 days after your period ends, when breasts are least tender. If you no longer menstruate, choose the same day each month.

**Important**: Self-examination supplements but does not replace regular clinical examinations and mammograms.`,

- Consider supplemental screening if dense breasts

**Ages 50-74:**
- Annual mammograms
- Annual clinical breast exams
- Continue monthly self-examinations
- Follow up on any unusual findings promptly

**Ages 75+:**
- Discuss screening with healthcare provider
- Consider overall health and life expectancy
- Continue self-examinations

**High-Risk Individuals:**
- Earlier and more frequent screening
- May include MRI in addition to mammography
- Genetic testing consideration
- Enhanced surveillance protocols

**Preparing for Mammogram:**
- Schedule for week after period
- Avoid deodorant, powder, or lotion
- Wear two-piece outfit

      title: 'Common Breast Health Concerns FAQ',
      content: `Here are answers to frequently asked questions about breast health:

**Q: What should I do if I find a lump?**
A: Don't panic. Most breast lumps are benign. Schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider promptly for evaluation. Continue with regular activities while awaiting your appointment.

**Q: Is breast pain a sign of cancer?**
A: Breast pain is rarely a symptom of cancer. It's often related to hormonal changes, caffeine intake, or muscle strain. However, any persistent pain should be evaluated by a healthcare provider.

**Q: How do I know if my breasts are dense?**
A: Breast density can only be determined through mammography. Your radiologist will include this information in your mammogram report. Dense breasts may require additional screening methods.

**Q: Can men get breast cancer?**
A: Yes, though it's rare (less than 1% of all breast cancer cases). Men should also be aware of changes in their breast tissue and report any lumps or changes to their doctor.

**Q: Do underwire bras cause cancer?**
A: No credible scientific evidence supports a link between underwire bras and breast cancer. Choose bras that fit properly and are comfortable.

**Q: Can stress cause breast cancer?**
A: While chronic stress may weaken the immune system, there's no direct evidence that stress causes breast cancer. However, managing stress is important for overall health.

**Q: How often should I examine my breasts?**
A: Monthly self-examinations are recommended, ideally 3-5 days after your period ends. If you no longer menstruate, choose the same day each month.

**Q: What's the difference between a lump and dense tissue?**
A: Dense tissue feels firm and slightly lumpy throughout the breast. A concerning lump is typically a distinct, hard mass that feels different from surrounding tissue.

Remember: When in doubt, consult your healthcare provider. It's always better to have unnecessary concerns checked than to ignore potentially important symptoms.`,
