# Alternative GitHub Upload Methods

## Issue: ZIP Download Not Available
Since Replit ZIP download isn't working, here are alternative approaches:

## Method 1: Manual File Copy (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Repository Files
1. Go to https://github.com/leedennyps/leadgen.to
2. Click "Add file" â†’ "Create new file"
3. Create each key file manually by copying content:

### Core Files to Create:

**1. package.json**
```bash
# Copy content from this Replit's package.json
```

**2. vercel.json** 
```bash  
# Copy deployment configuration
```

**3. README.md**
```bash
# Copy project documentation  
```

**4. Key folders:**
- Create `client/src/` directory structure
- Create `server/` directory structure  
- Create `shared/` directory structure

## Method 2: GitHub CLI Alternative
```bash
# If you have GitHub CLI locally:
gh auth login --with-token < token.txt
gh repo clone leedennyps/leadgen.to
# Copy files manually
gh add . && gh commit -m "Initial platform" && gh push
```

## Method 3: Direct Vercel Deployment
Skip GitHub temporarily and deploy directly:

1. **Export project key files** by copying code manually
2. **Create new local project** with copied code
3. **Deploy directly to Vercel** using Vercel CLI
4. **Add GitHub later** for version control

## Method 4: Replit Git Integration
Try using Replit's built-in Git:
1. Go to Version Control panel (left sidebar)
2. Try "Connect to GitHub" with your token
3. Push directly from Replit interface

## Immediate Action Plan
Let's use **Method 1** - I'll help you copy the key files manually to GitHub, which is actually faster than waiting for ZIP downloads.
