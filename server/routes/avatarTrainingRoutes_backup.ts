**Ages 20-39:**
- Monthly breast self-exams
- Clinical breast exams every 1-3 years
- Baseline mammogram may be recommended if high-risk

**Ages 40-49:**
- Annual mammograms (some guidelines suggest every 1-2 years)
- Annual clinical breast exams
- Continue monthly self-exams
- Consider MRI screening if very high-risk (BRCA mutations, strong family history)

**Ages 50 and older:**
- Annual mammograms (standard recommendation)
- Annual clinical breast exams
- Continue monthly self-exams

**HIGH-RISK FACTORS requiring earlier screening:**
- BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations
- Family history of breast/ovarian cancer (especially first-degree relatives)
- Previous chest radiation therapy before age 30
- Li-Fraumeni syndrome or other genetic conditions
- Dense breast tissue (may require additional imaging)

**WHAT TO EXPECT:**
- The procedure takes about 20 minutes
- Breast compression is necessary for clear images but lasts only seconds per view
- Most women experience mild discomfort, which is temporary
- Results are typically available within 1-2 weeks
- 3D mammography (tomosynthesis) improves detection rates, especially in dense breasts

**PREPARATION TIPS:**
- Schedule for the week after your period when breasts are least tender
- Avoid deodorant, powder, or lotion on breast/underarm areas
- Wear a two-piece outfit for easier undressing
- Bring previous mammogram films for comparison if changing facilities

Regular screening can detect cancers 2 years before they're large enough to feel during physical examination.`;

          return `Understanding breast cancer risk factors helps you make informed decisions about screening and prevention. Let me break down the key factors and what you can control.

**UNCHANGEABLE RISK FACTORS:**

**Age**: The strongest risk factor - most breast cancers occur after age 50
**Gender**: Women are 100 times more likely than men to develop breast cancer
**Genetics**: 
- BRCA1 mutations: 55-72% lifetime risk
- BRCA2 mutations: 45-69% lifetime risk
- Other genes: PALB2, TP53, CDH1, ATM, CHEK2

**Family History**:
- First-degree relative (mother, sister, daughter): Doubles your risk
- Multiple relatives or young age at diagnosis increases risk further
- IMPORTANT: 85% of breast cancers occur in women with NO family history

**Personal History**:
- Previous breast cancer or high-risk lesions (LCIS, atypical hyperplasia)
- Dense breast tissue (Category C or D on mammogram)
- Radiation therapy to chest before age 30

**CONTROLLABLE RISK FACTORS:**

**Hormone Exposure**:
- Extended hormone replacement therapy (especially combined estrogen/progestin)
- Late menopause (after 55) or early menstruation (before 12)
- Never being pregnant or first pregnancy after 30

**Lifestyle Factors**:
- Regular alcohol consumption (risk increases with amount)
- Being overweight or obese after menopause
- Physical inactivity
- Smoking (especially if started before first pregnancy)

**PROTECTIVE FACTORS YOU CAN CONTROL:**

**Physical Activity**: 150 minutes moderate exercise weekly reduces risk by 10-20%
**Healthy Weight**: Maintain BMI under 25, especially after menopause
**Limit Alcohol**: No more than 1 drink per day (preferably less)
**Breastfeeding**: Each year of breastfeeding reduces risk by 4.3%
**Avoid Unnecessary Hormones**: Discuss alternatives to HRT with your doctor

**RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS:**
- Gail Model: Calculates 5-year and lifetime risk
- Tyrer-Cuzick Model: More comprehensive for family history
- BOADICEA: Best for known genetic mutations

Remember: Having risk factors doesn't mean you'll develop cancer, and many women with multiple risk factors never do. Focus on controlling what you can and following appropriate screening guidelines.`;
        } else {
          return `Comprehensive breast health involves multiple strategies working together for optimal protection and early detection.

**THE THREE PILLARS OF BREAST HEALTH:**

**1. AWARENESS & SELF-EXAMINATION**
Monthly self-exams help you learn what's normal for your body. Perform them 3-7 days after your period when hormonal effects are minimal. Look for changes in size, shape, texture, or appearance. Any new, persistent lumps or changes should be evaluated promptly.

**2. PROFESSIONAL SCREENING**
Clinical breast exams by healthcare providers can detect changes you might miss. Combined with mammography, this creates a comprehensive detection system. Digital breast tomosynthesis (3D mammography) improves cancer detection rates by 20-40%, especially in dense breast tissue.

**3. RISK REDUCTION STRATEGIES**
Lifestyle modifications can significantly impact your risk:
- Maintain healthy weight (BMI under 25)
- Exercise regularly (150 minutes weekly moderate activity)
- Limit alcohol consumption (no more than 1 drink daily)
- Avoid smoking
- Consider breastfeeding if planning children
- Discuss hormone replacement therapy risks with your doctor

**UNDERSTANDING BREAST DENSITY:**
Dense breast tissue (50% of women) can:
- Make mammograms harder to read
- Increase cancer risk 4-6 times
- Require additional screening (ultrasound or MRI)
- Be managed with personalized screening protocols

**WHEN TO SEEK IMMEDIATE EVALUATION:**
- New lump that persists after menstrual cycle
- Skin changes (dimpling, puckering, redness)
- Nipple discharge (especially bloody)
- Nipple retraction or change in direction
- Breast or nipple pain that's new or persistent
- Swollen lymph nodes in armpit or above collarbone

**GENETIC CONSIDERATIONS:**
If you have strong family history (multiple relatives, young age at diagnosis, male breast cancer), consider genetic counseling. BRCA testing may be appropriate, and positive results can guide enhanced screening or preventive options.

Your personalized screening plan should be developed with your healthcare provider based on your individual risk factors, family history, and personal preferences.`;

        return `Here's the complete sales strategy framework you need for consistent results and measurable ROI.

**SALES PROCESS OPTIMIZATION:**

**1. LEAD QUALIFICATION (BANT Framework):**
- **Budget**: "What budget range are you working with for this type of solution?"
- **Authority**: "Who else would be involved in making this decision?"
- **Need**: "What's driving you to look for a solution now?"
- **Timeline**: "When do you need this implemented?"

**2. VALUE-BASED SELLING TECHNIQUE:**
- Calculate total cost of inaction (what problems cost them annually)
- Present ROI with specific numbers: "This saves 10 hours weekly = $15,000 annually"
- Use the 3-option strategy: Good, Better, Best pricing to create anchoring effect
- Focus on business outcomes, not features

**3. OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS:**

*Price Objection*: "I understand cost is important. Many successful companies initially had similar concerns. What's the cost of not solving this problem? Let's look at the ROI over 12 months..."

*Competition Objection*: "That's great you're doing thorough research. What criteria are most important in your decision? Let me show you how we specifically address [their key concern]..."

*Timing Objection*: "I appreciate you being upfront about timing. What would need to happen for this to become a priority? Is there a smaller pilot we could start with?"

**4. CLOSING TECHNIQUES:**
- **Assumptive Close**: "When would you like to start implementation?"
- **Alternative Choice Close**: "Would you prefer the 6-month or 12-month package?"
- **Urgency Close**: "This pricing is available through month-end. Should we move forward?"

**PERFORMANCE METRICS TO TRACK:**
- Activity: 30-50 calls daily, 20-30 emails, 15-20 meetings weekly
- Conversion: Lead-to-opportunity (15-30%), opportunity-to-close (40-60%)
- Pipeline velocity: (# opportunities × average deal size × win rate) ÷ sales cycle length

This framework should generate predictable results when executed consistently.`;

      if (avatarType === 'miko_harmony') {
        return `Here's the comprehensive customer service excellence framework for transforming difficult situations into loyalty opportunities.

**DE-ESCALATION METHODOLOGY (HEART System):**

**H - HALT**: Stop talking and listen completely. Let the customer vent without interruption for 60-90 seconds.

**E - EMPATHIZE**: Use phrases like "I understand how frustrating this must be" or "You're absolutely right to be concerned about this."

**A - APOLOGIZE**: Apologize for the situation, not necessarily blame: "I'm sorry this happened to you" or "I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused."

**R - RESPOND**: Provide specific solutions with timelines: "Here's exactly what I'm going to do to fix this for you..."

**T - THANK**: Thank them for their patience and for bringing this to your attention.

**ADVANCED COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES:**

**Voice Management**: Lower your tone and speak 10-15% slower than the customer to guide them toward calmness.

**Active Listening Phrases**:
- "Let me make sure I understand..."
- "What I'm hearing is..."
- "Help me understand..."

**Solution-Focused Language**:
- "Here's what I CAN do for you..."
- "Let me find the best way to resolve this..."
- "I'm committed to making this right..."

**SERVICE RECOVERY PARADOX:**
Customers who experience problems that get resolved exceptionally become MORE loyal than those who never had problems. Use the "Last 10%" principle - go slightly beyond what's required.

**DIFFICULT CUSTOMER TYPES & STRATEGIES:**

**The Angry Customer**: Acknowledge their emotion first, then facts: "I can hear how upset you are, and I want to help resolve this immediately."

**The Demanding Customer**: Set clear expectations: "I'm going to personally ensure this gets resolved. Here's exactly what will happen and when..."

**The Confused Customer**: Break down complex information: "Let me walk you through this step by step to make sure it's clear..."

**FOLLOW-UP PROTOCOL:**
- Contact within 24-48 hours to ensure resolution satisfaction
- Document everything for future reference
- Convert complaints into process improvements
- Celebrate success stories with team

This approach transforms 85% of angry customers into satisfied customers when executed properly.`;
