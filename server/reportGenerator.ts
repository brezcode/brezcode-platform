Most breast cancers are estrogen-driven, making hormonal balance crucial for prevention. To optimize hormonal health, maintain a healthy weight through balanced nutrition and regular exercise, as fat tissue produces estrogen. Limit alcohol consumption, which can increase estrogen levels and interfere with hormone metabolism. Include cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, kale, cabbage) in your diet, as they support healthy estrogen metabolism.
