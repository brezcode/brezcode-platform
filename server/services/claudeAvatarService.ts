Recent conversation:
${recentMessages}

Generate a thoughtful, contextual follow-up question that a real patient would ask. The question should:
1. Show deeper engagement with the medical topic discussed
2. Reflect genuine patient concerns and anxieties
3. Build naturally on the conversation flow
4. Demonstrate the patient is processing and thinking about the advice
5. Include specific details that show active listening

For breast health scenarios, patients might ask about:
- Specific techniques or procedures mentioned
- Personal risk factors and family history implications  
- Timing and frequency of screenings
- What to expect during procedures
- Signs and symptoms to watch for
- Lifestyle modifications and their effectiveness
- How to manage anxiety about findings

Respond with a JSON object:
