# Super Easy Upload Method - No Coding Required!

## What to Do in Your BreastHealthMigrate Project

Since you have the project ready, here's the absolute easiest way:

### Step 1: Download Files From This Project
I'll give you the exact files to download from this current project and upload to yours.

### Step 2: Simple Drag & Drop
You can drag and drop files directly into your Replit project.

## Files You Need to Copy

### From this project (`migration_package/` folder):

**Download these files from the current project and upload to your BreastHealthMigrate:**

1. **package.json** → Upload to root folder
2. **vite.config.ts** → Upload to root folder  
3. **tailwind.config.ts** → Upload to root folder
4. **client/index.html** → Create `client` folder, upload this
5. **client/src/main.tsx** → Create `client/src` folder, upload this
6. **client/src/App.tsx** → Upload to `client/src/`
7. **client/src/index.css** → Upload to `client/src/`
8. **server/index.ts** → Create `server` folder, upload this
9. **server/simple-routes.ts** → Upload to `server/`
10. **shared/schema.ts** → Create `shared` folder, upload this

## Alternative: I Can Create Archive File

Would you prefer if I:
1. **Create a downloadable ZIP file** with all the files ready?
2. **Guide you to download each file individually** from this project?
3. **Or give you the complete file contents to copy-paste one by one** (simplest)?

Which method would be easiest for you? I want to make this as simple as possible!
