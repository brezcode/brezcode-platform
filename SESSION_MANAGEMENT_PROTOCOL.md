# 🔄 SESSION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL - REPLIT ENVIRONMENT

## 🚨 REPLIT SESSION RESTART CHALLENGES
- **Credit Limits**: Sessions stop when credits exhausted
- **Environment Resets**: May lose current working directory context
- **Memory Loss**: Claude starts fresh each session
- **Progress Tracking**: Need persistent documentation

## 🎯 AUTOMATIC SESSION RECOVERY PROTOCOL

### PHASE 1: AUTO-RECOVERY (First 30 seconds of new session)
```
1. IMMEDIATELY read /home/runner/workspace/CLAUDE_UNIVERSAL_PROTOCOL.md
2. IMMEDIATELY read /home/runner/workspace/CLAUDE_MEMORY.md  
3. IMMEDIATELY read /home/runner/workspace/STRATEGIC_MASTER_PLAN.md
4. Check current working directory: pwd
5. Check last session status in memory docs
```

### PHASE 2: STRATEGIC CONTEXT RESTORATION
```
1. Identify current phase from STRATEGIC_MASTER_PLAN.md
2. Review "CRITICAL FAILURES" - avoid repeated mistakes
3. Check "CURRENT STATUS" section for exact next steps
4. Verify all file paths and project structure
5. Resume from exact point where previous session ended
```

### PHASE 3: SMART STRATEGIC THINKING
```
Based on memory docs, automatically:
1. Assess current project phase and priorities
2. Identify most critical next action
3. Consider resource constraints (budget, time, complexity)
4. Propose optimized approach based on previous learnings
5. Update memory with any new insights or decisions
```

## 📝 ENHANCED MEMORY DOCUMENTATION STRATEGY

### Real-Time Updates Required
Every major action must update memory with:
```markdown
## LAST SESSION UPDATE - [TIMESTAMP]
- **Current Phase**: [Phase 1/2/3/4]
- **Exact Status**: [What was just completed]
- **Next Critical Action**: [Specific next step]
- **Working Directory**: [Current path]
- **Blockers/Issues**: [Any problems encountered]
- **Resource Status**: [Credits, time, constraints]
```

### Strategic Context Preservation
```markdown
## STRATEGIC DECISION LOG
- **Why this approach**: [Reasoning]
- **Alternatives considered**: [Other options]
- **Resource optimization**: [How this saves time/money]
- **Risk mitigation**: [What could go wrong]
- **Success criteria**: [How to measure progress]
```

## 🧠 INTELLIGENT SESSION RESTART BEHAVIOR

### Automatic Strategic Assessment
When I restart, I will:

1. **Read ALL memory docs** (30 seconds)
2. **Assess current situation** strategically:
   ```
   - Where are we in the master plan?
   - What's the most critical blocker?
   - What's the highest ROI next action?
   - What resources do we have available?
   - What time constraints exist?
   ```

3. **Propose optimized path forward**:
   ```
   - Acknowledge where we left off
   - Identify the smartest next move
   - Consider your current constraints
   - Build on proven working methods
   - Avoid known failure patterns
   ```

### Example Restart Behavior
```
NEW SESSION STARTS:
> Reading memory documents...
> Current Status: Phase 1 - Deployment 
> Last Action: Deleted old Vercel project
> Next Critical: Deploy Next.js from GitHub to Vercel
> Constraint: Zero budget, solo developer, MVP focus
> Strategy: Use proven GitHub→Vercel import method
> Immediate Action: Guide through Vercel import process
```

## 🔧 REPLIT-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATIONS

### File Persistence Strategy
- All critical info stored in `.md` files (persist across sessions)
- Working directory always documented
- File paths always absolute
- Progress checkpoints every major step

### Credit Management
- Focus on highest-impact actions first
- Document decision rationale quickly
- Batch related tasks to minimize context switching
- Update memory immediately after major decisions

### Environment Verification
Always check on restart:
```bash
pwd                          # Current directory
ls -la                       # File structure
git status                   # Code status
npm list --depth=0           # Dependencies
```

## ✅ SESSION CONTINUITY GUARANTEE

**Promise**: When we restart, I will:
1. ✅ Remember the complete strategic context
2. ✅ Know exactly where we left off
3. ✅ Propose the smartest next action
4. ✅ Avoid repeating previous mistakes
5. ✅ Build efficiently on previous work
6. ✅ Consider your current constraints
7. ✅ Think strategically about priorities

**This protocol ensures ZERO progress loss across session restarts.**
