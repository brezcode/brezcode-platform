# Multi-Platform Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete architecture strategy for the BrezCode multi-platform ecosystem, featuring a "Copy-on-Need" development approach with complete platform isolation.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Platform Independence
- Each platform (BrezCode, SkinCoach, LeadGen) operates completely independently
- Zero runtime dependencies between platforms
- No shared services that could cause cascading failures
- Independent deployment, scaling, and technology choices

### 2. Copy-on-Need Development Strategy
- Central repository serves as "Shared Tools Laboratory"
- Tools, components, and services developed once in this repo
- Selective copying to individual platforms only when needed
- Manual synchronization ensures conscious decision-making

### 3. Complete Data Isolation
- Separate databases per platform for maximum security
- No shared schemas or cross-platform data dependencies
- Compliance-specific isolation (HIPAA, GDPR, Business)
- Independent backup, disaster recovery, and audit trails

## 🗄️ Database Architecture

### Production Databases
```bash
# Platform-Specific Databases (Completely Isolated)
brezcode_production     # Breast health data (HIPAA compliant)
skincoach_production    # Skin analysis data (GDPR compliant)  
leadgen_production      # Business automation data

# Optional Shared Services (Minimal)
shared_auth_production  # User authentication only
shared_logs_production  # System logs and analytics only
```

### Database Connection Strategy
```typescript
// Environment-specific database connections
const dbConnections = {
  brezcode: process.env.BREZCODE_DB_URL,
  skincoach: process.env.SKINCOACH_DB_URL,
  leadgen: process.env.LEADGEN_DB_URL,
  shared_auth: process.env.SHARED_AUTH_DB_URL,
  shared_logs: process.env.SHARED_LOGS_DB_URL
};
```

### Data Migration Strategy
- Independent migration scripts per platform
- No cross-platform foreign keys or dependencies
- Platform-specific schemas and data models
- Separate backup and restore procedures

## 🔧 Shared Tools Laboratory

### Current Shared Components
- **WhatsApp Multi-Platform Service**: Copy to platforms needing messaging
- **Camera/Image Analysis Tools**: Currently used only in SkinCoach
- **AI Avatar Services**: Copy to platforms needing AI interaction
- **Authentication Middleware**: Copy to platforms requiring login
- **Domain Routing Logic**: Copy to platforms with custom domains

### Tool Development Workflow
1. **Develop**: Create tool/component in this repository
2. **Test**: Thoroughly test in isolation
3. **Document**: Create copying instructions and usage guide
4. **Version**: Tag releases for tracking
5. **Copy**: Manual deployment to target platforms
6. **Customize**: Platform-specific modifications after copying

### Tool Catalog Structure
```
/shared-tools/
  ├── whatsapp-api/           # Multi-platform messaging
  ├── camera-analysis/        # Image processing tools
  ├── ai-services/           # Avatar and AI components
  ├── auth-middleware/       # Authentication systems
  ├── domain-routing/        # Custom domain handling
  ├── analytics/             # Tracking and metrics
  └── deployment-scripts/    # Copy-to-platform automation
```

## 🌐 Domain and Deployment Architecture

### Domain Strategy
- **www.brezcode.com**: Breast health AI coaching platform
- **www.skincoach.ai**: Skin analysis and dermatology platform
- **leadgen.to**: Business automation and lead generation platform

### Deployment Strategy
- **This Repository**: Shared tools development and testing
- **Platform Repositories**: Individual deployments with copied tools
- **Vercel Deployment**: Multi-domain support with separate projects
- **Environment Isolation**: Platform-specific environment variables

### Domain Routing Implementation
```typescript
// Server-side domain detection
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const host = req.get('host');
  
  if (host === 'www.brezcode.com') {
    // Route to BrezCode-specific content
    req.platform = 'brezcode';
  } else if (host === 'www.skincoach.ai') {
    // Route to SkinCoach-specific content
    req.platform = 'skincoach';
  } else if (host === 'leadgen.to') {
    // Route to LeadGen-specific content
    req.platform = 'leadgen';
  }
  
  next();
});
```

## 🔒 Security and Compliance

### Platform-Specific Security Models
- **BrezCode**: HIPAA compliance for health data
- **SkinCoach**: GDPR compliance for personal image data
- **LeadGen**: Standard business data protection

### Security Benefits of Architecture
- **Blast Radius Containment**: Breaches isolated per platform
- **Compliance Isolation**: Different regulatory requirements per platform
- **Independent Auditing**: Each platform audited separately
- **Risk Distribution**: No single point of failure across all platforms

### Access Control Strategy
```typescript
// Platform-specific access control
const platformAuth = {
  brezcode: {
    encryption: 'AES-256-GCM',
    compliance: 'HIPAA',
    auditLevel: 'MAXIMUM'
  },
  skincoach: {
    encryption: 'AES-256-GCM', 
    compliance: 'GDPR',
    auditLevel: 'HIGH'
  },
  leadgen: {
    encryption: 'AES-256-CBC',
    compliance: 'SOC2',
    auditLevel: 'STANDARD'
  }
};
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Analytics

### Platform-Specific Monitoring
- Independent monitoring dashboards per platform
- Separate alerting systems and escalation procedures
- Platform-specific performance metrics and KPIs
- Isolated log aggregation and analysis

### Shared Analytics (Optional)
- Cross-platform business intelligence (anonymized)
- Technology performance comparisons
- Development efficiency metrics
- Cost optimization analysis

## 🚀 Development Workflow

### New Feature Development
1. **Identify Need**: Determine which platforms need the feature
2. **Develop in Lab**: Build and test in this repository
3. **Document Integration**: Create platform-specific integration guides
4. **Copy Selectively**: Deploy only to platforms that need it
5. **Monitor Independence**: Ensure no cross-platform dependencies

### Platform-Specific Customization
- After copying, platforms can modify tools for specific needs
- No requirement to maintain compatibility with other platforms
- Platform teams own their copied code completely
- Updates pushed only when beneficial to specific platform

## 📈 Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling
- Each platform scales independently based on demand
- No shared bottlenecks or resource contention
- Platform-specific optimization strategies
- Independent infrastructure provisioning

### Vertical Scaling
- Database scaling per platform needs
- AI service scaling based on platform usage patterns
- Storage scaling for platform-specific data types
- Network optimization per platform requirements

## 🔮 Future Architecture Evolution

### Migration Paths
- **Current**: Copy-on-Need with Platform Isolation
- **Phase 2**: Microservices per platform (if needed)
- **Phase 3**: Full distributed architecture (if scale requires)
- **Always**: Maintain platform independence as core principle

### Technology Evolution
- Platforms free to adopt new technologies independently
- No requirement for technology stack consistency
- Innovation testing in individual platforms before lab integration
- Continuous architecture optimization per platform needs
